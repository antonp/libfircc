@section intro_sec Introduction

This documentation is a work in progress.
It currently only contains antogenerated api documentation.
Start by looking at the "classes" tab.
Also, there is a sample console application in the source distribution,
which is the closest thing to tutorial at this point.

Contributions to this documentation are welcome.
